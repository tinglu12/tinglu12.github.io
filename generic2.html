							<p>A2-GO is a project that was inspired by games like Pokemon Go to create an augmented reality video game for mobile devices. 
								In this game, the player is tasked with planting seeds in order to grow trees, allowing them to earn in-game money. 
								However, while playing the game, their trees can suddenly be attacked by squirrels which they must defeat. 
								Along with this, they can use their money to buy more seeds, and walk to different landmarks to unlock new seeds. 
								Overall, this game provides an interactive experience while requiring a physical aspect to it.  
								<br>
								<br>
								Our core development platform is Unity 2022.3.17f1. For programming logic and gameplay mechanics, we utilized C#. Project management was handled through JIRA, a powerful tool for tracking development progress among team members. Version control was managed using Git, providing our team with a robust framework for tracking changes and collaborating on code. To enrich our virtual environments, we sourced high-quality 3D models and textures from Sketchfab and the Unity Asset Store. Audio elements were carefully selected from Freesound, a comprehensive database of royalty-free sound effects and music tracks. Testing and optimization of our application were conducted using an Iphone.							</p>
