Overview:
A2-GO is a project that was inspired by games like Pokemon Go to create an augmented reality video game for mobile devices. 
In this game, the player is tasked with planting seeds in order to grow trees, allowing them to earn in-game money. 
However, while playing the game, their trees can suddenly be attacked by squirrels which they must defeat. 
Along with this, they can use their money to buy more seeds, and walk to different landmarks to unlock new seeds. 
Overall, this game provides an interactive experience while requiring a physical aspect to it.  


Custom Mechanic/Feature: 


Summary:
Our custom feature for our project is to make a rock paper scissor system with elements. 
Like Pokemon, certain elements beat others, with the most basic ones being that fire beats grass, grass beats water, and water beats fire. 
In our game, we created a similar system by creating new squirrels and acorns.


Custom Squirrels:
We’ve implemented three new squirrels: a water squirrel, a fire squirrel, and a grass squirrel. 
Each squirrel will have a custom feature. The water squirrel will surround itself with water periodically, making any acorn thrown at it useless. 
The fire squirrel will shoot fire at the player, forcing the player to dodge its attacks. 
If the player is hit, then the player will lose some money. 
The grass squirrel will move much faster than the other squirrels in the game, making it difficult to hit it. 
These new squirrels will be randomly spawned whenever a squirrel spawn is triggered, and the only way to beat these squirrels is with our new custom acorns.


Custom Acorns:
We’ve implemented new acorns that can be bought from the shop inorder to stop our new squirrels: the water acorn, the fire acorn, and the grass acorn. 
Each acorn is used to stop one of the new squirrels. 
The water acorn can defeat the fire squirrel, the fire acorn can defeat the grass squirrel, and the grass acorn can defeat the water squirrel. 
Any other acorns besides the respective acorns above will have no effect on the new squirrels. 
For example, the water squirrel will not be defeated if it is hit by the water or fire acorn. 
All new acorns can be used to defeat the regular squirrel. 








Technologies Used:
Our core development platform is Unity 2022.3.17f1. 
For programming logic and gameplay mechanics, we utilized C#. 
Project management was handled through JIRA, a powerful tool for tracking development progress among team members. 
Version control was managed using Git, providing our team with a robust framework for tracking changes and collaborating on code. 
To enrich our virtual environments, we sourced high-quality 3D models and textures from Sketchfab and the Unity Asset Store. 
Audio elements were carefully selected from Freesound, a comprehensive database of royalty-free sound effects and music tracks. 
Testing and optimization of our application were conducted using an Iphone.
